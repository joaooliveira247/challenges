# Difference of Squares

Find the difference between the square of the sum and the sum of the squares of the first N natural numbers.

The square of the `sum` of the first `ten natural numbers` is `(1 + 2 + ... + 10)² = 55² = 3025`.

The `sum` of the squares of the first `ten natural numbers` is `1² + 2² + ... + 10² = 385`.

Hence, the `difference` between the `square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers` and `the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers` is `3025 - 385 = 2640`.
